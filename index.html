          <h3>First Date</h3>
          <p>
            I’m not sure what to call our “first date.” Was it that pseudo-date
            at the end of the fields, or our duty time as prefects? Or maybe the
            Mario Movie date? Whatever it was, every moment with you has meant
            more to me than anything else in my life.

          <h3>First Kiss</h3>
          <p>
            It was November, after EAMUN training, in the bus. The rain tapping
            the roof, the moon glowing faintly, fog on the windows. An awkward
            laugh, a soft brush of lips—and just like that, I was hooked.

          <h3>Trip Together</h3>
          <p>
            Most of our “trips” have been school bus rides, but our hike stands
            out. Dusty hands, messy hair, aching legs—yet I never wanted it to
            end. Holding your hand made my fear of heights vanish. I just wanted
            to be next to you.

          <h3>Future Dreams</h3>
          <p>
            I don’t know where the future will take us—maybe France, maybe
            India. Different time zones, different lives… But one thing’s for
            sure: no matter where we go, our story ends the same way—with 4
            dogs, 2 kids, and a garden that grows old with us.
